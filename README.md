## Description

simple-linear-regression.ipynb is an ipython notebook that contains three separate examples of graphing best fits using linear regression.  The first two are fairly simple examples, but the final, Salary Discrimination, looks at a number of different factors that may have influenced salary in an attempt to determine if men and women have meaningful differences in salory based solely on their gender.
